        <p className='section-text'>
          There are eight fundamental, doctrinal beliefs that have characterized
          Bible believing churches throughout the ages. These beliefs are how we
          trace our lineage back to the time of Jesus Christ. The following
          beliefs are based directly on the Word of God, and have passed from
          one generation to the next.

            1. We believe that the <span className='emph'>BIBLE</span> is the
            final authority for all faith and practice.
          </h3>
          <p className='statement-text section-text'>
            We believe in a verbal plenary inspiration. That is, God gave the
            actual words of the Bible (Verbal), and the entire Bible is from Him
            (plenary).
          </p>
          <p className='verse'>
            All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
            doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
            righteousness

            That is, each church is independently governed under God. This is
            the pattern of the New Testament church throughout all of Scripture.

          <p className='statement-text section-text'>
            Jesus is our High Priest who gave each and every believer the
            privilege to go before the throne of God without an earthly
            intercessor.

          <p className='verse'>
            But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation,

            7. We believe there are <span className='emph'>TWO ORDINANCES</span>{' '}
            of the local church. Baptism and Communion.
          </h3>
          <p className='statement-text section-text'>
            <strong>Baptism</strong> is the immersion of a believer in water to
            show his faith in, and identity with Christ in His death, burial,
            resurrection and the Spirit-filled life. It is a symbol and
            demonstration on the conversion experience.
          </p>
          <p className='verse'>
            Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name
            of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
            <span className='ref'>Matthew 28:19</span>
          </p>
          <p className='statement-text section-text'>
            <strong>Communion</strong> is a memorial of the atoning death,
            burial, resurrection, and personal return of Christ, and that only
            born-again believers are to participate in it. We believe that the
            elements, bread and the juice of the grape, are symbols of Christâ€™s
            body and blood and have no merit in themselves.

          <p className='statement-text section-text'>
            We are to obey the laws of the Government.
