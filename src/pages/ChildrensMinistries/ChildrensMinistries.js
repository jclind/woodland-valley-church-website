              Our dedicated teachers will lovingly lead your children in
              exciting Bible discovery. Upon arrival Sunday morning, your
              children will be checked into the ministry at our Welcome Desk
              where they will receive a name tag that serves as a pick up tag
              for parents. Jesus Jungle begins with a corporate time of worship
              before children are dismissed to their individual classrooms. â€‹
