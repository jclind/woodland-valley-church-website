      'Each Sunday morning at 10:00am, during our worship service, we have a number of great ministries for your children from four years old to eleven years old.  We call this Jesus Jungle, and it’s a great, kid-friendly, age appropriate, fun time for all your children.  Our dedicated teachers will lovingly lead your children in exciting Bible discovery.  Upon arrival Sunday morning, your children will be checked into the ministry at our Welcome Desk where they will receive a name tag that serves as a pick up tag for parents.  Jesus Jungle begins with a corporate time of worship before children are dismissed to their individual classrooms.',
