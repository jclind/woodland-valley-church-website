      'Prayerâ€¦ What in the world is it?  Well, first it is not of this world.  It is finite human beings communicating with the infinite God of all creation.  Yeah, that alone should take our breath away.  Yet, prayer is exactly what the LORD allows us access to and expects us to do every day.  In this 3-week series we will look at what prayer is, how to pray effectively, and how to literally put feet to our faith through prayer.  Join us beginning October 10th as we explore the transforming power of prayer.',
